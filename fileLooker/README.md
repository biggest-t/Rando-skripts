# This is the fileLooker

i really wanted to make a semi working file manager as a warm up

this aint that good, the code is un optimized, but hey it was a fun project for 2 hours or something 

### how to use?

idk figure it out im too lazy to write a tutorial, its just 50 lines of code cmon it cant be that hard

*though the code is a little messy and hard to read so yeah cant blame yah if you still couldnt figure it out*

*thank you to StackOverflow for being the light of my life*
